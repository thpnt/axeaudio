# AxeAudio

AxeAudio is an exploration of the capabilities of Generative AI for creating a business solution. In this project, I leveraged OpenAI's API, specifically Whisper and GPT, to transcribe audio files with Whisper and perform audio post-processing using GPT.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

The primary objectives of the AxeAudio project include:

- **Transcription with Whisper**: Utilizing OpenAI's Whisper API for accurate and efficient audio transcription.

- **Audio Post-Processing with GPT**: Applying GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) for audio post-processing to enhance the quality of transcribed audio.

### Learning Journey

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights and skills in the following areas:

- **Generative AI**: Exploring the potential of Generative AI in solving real-world business problems.

- **API Integration**: Learning how to integrate and work with external APIs, specifically OpenAI's Whisper and GPT.

- **Multithreading**: Implementing threaded processing to improve efficiency, especially in handling large audio files.

- **Audio File Manipulation**: Developing proficiency in working with audio files for transcription and post-processing.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Applying prompt engineering techniques, inspired by Andrew Ng's course on LLMs and Prompt Engineering from deeplearning.ai, to interact effectively with GPT.

### Future Development

AxeAudio serves as the first version or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an AI solution that holds significant potential for industrialization. The long-term vision is to deploy this solution for processing all incoming and outgoing calls within the company, optimizing workflows, and enhancing communication efficiency.

## About Me
